# semantically-guided-video-compression
Video compression algorithm which seeks to compress video by finding the subset of frames/clips which retain the semantics of the video.  Assumes posed rgb frames as an input.  Applications vary, but efficient memory for robots over long time horizons (hours, days, months) is the motivation.
