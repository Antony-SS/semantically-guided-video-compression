# semantically-guided-video-compression
Video compression algorithm which seeks to compress video by finding the subset of frames/clips which retain the semantics of the video.  Assumes posed rgb frames as an input.  Applications vary, but efficient memory for robots over long time horizons (hours, days, months) is the motivation. 

A good thought exercise is: if someone asked you "tell me about your day" what would you tell them?  You probably wouldn't be able to recall the details of the blank hallway you walked down, but you might remember going on a run with your friend, the kind person on the elevator, and the car that honked at you.
